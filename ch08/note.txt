1) [Database] foreign keys
    k is Table A's prim key, and k in Table B.
    we call key is B's "foreign key";

2) [Database] referential integrity
    k,kb,kc are prim key for Table A,B,C;
    k,kc is B's foreign key;
    the k,kb,kc must match each other, we call this is "referential integrity"

3) [Database] relationship
    one-to-one         --
        some time, two table have one-to-one relation,can join together. but
not all condition need join together.

    one-to-many       |->
                      |->
    many-to-many      <->

4) [Database] junction table
    Table A,C have no direct relation, but connect by Table B (B has A,C's
index). We call B is A,C's "junction table".
