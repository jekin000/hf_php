1) [sql] LIKE
    SELECT job_id FROM riskyjobs WHERE title LIKE '%fighter%'
    
    other LIKE
    LIKE '__fighter%'

2) .=
    like string's "+="

3) explode(delimiter, origin string)
    split string to list

4) implode(delimiter,list)
    combine list to a string with delimiter.
    suppose there are three keys:
    A,B,C, we will combine them with OR
    
    1)if we use foreach()
        $arrs[] = [A,B,C]
        foreach($arrs as $arr){
            $str += OR
        }
        $result = A OR B OR C OR
        there is an additional OR
    2) $result = implode('OR',$arrs);


5) [] , array_push()
    the [] is equal array_push()

    e.g.
        foreach($words as $word){
            $new_list[] = 'i am '.$word;
        }
