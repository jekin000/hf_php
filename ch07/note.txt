1. [sql]
    ALTER TABLE xxx ADD uuu  ttt NOT NULL AFTER iii,
                    ADD ppp  ttt NOT NULL AFTER uuu;
    NOTICE there is a AFTER

2. [sql]

    password encrypted
    SHA()
    MD5()
    the SHA() algorithm is considered a little more secure than MD5().
    e.g.
            INSERT INTO mismatch_user(
                username, password, join_date) 
            VALUES ('jnettles', SHA('tatlover'), NOW())

        SELECT * FROM mismatch_user
        WHERE password = SHA('tatlover')

4.php also have encryped method, which is sha1(),md5()

5.password transmission & storing
    SHA() is a way storing the password.

6.cookie VS HTTP Authentication VS session
    The HTTP Auth will still exsit until you close web browser. It do not
support log-out.

    The cookie is stored on your disk,and you can delete it which means
log-out. Cookie has expiration date, when arrive at this date, the cookie will
be automatic deleted.

    session, will store data on server. and support more data size than
cookie. Session do not support expiration , if the browser has been shut
down,the session will be close too.
    session can depand on cookie or not.If do not depand on cookie, there are
two ways to let session work well: 
    1) change session configure in php.ini;
    2) use session'ID in URL, and use $_GET,to fetch data from URL.

More details about cookie,session,HTTP Authen are in book Page 397.

7. php cookie
    setcookie('username','sidneyk');
    $_COOKIE['username'];
    if you do not set cookie's expiration date , the cookie will be deleted
when you close the web brower.

    e.g.
        add cookie:         setcookie('AA','aa');
        delete cookie:      setcookie('AA','',time-3600);
        delete cookie:      setcookie('AA','',time-3600,'/hf_ch07/');

8. Notice the cookie the book saved.
    The book only save two cookie,
    one for user_id, another for username.
    the user_id if for check user log status, wheras the username is for tell
user what he log as.

    It do not save password.
