    SHA()
    MD5()
    the SHA() algorithm is considered a little more secure than MD5().
    e.g.
            INSERT INTO mismatch_user(
                username, password, join_date) 
            VALUES ('jnettles', SHA('tatlover'), NOW())

        SELECT * FROM mismatch_user
        WHERE password = SHA('tatlover')
